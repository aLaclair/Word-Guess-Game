# Word-Guess-Game

## What is a Word-Guess-Game?

Word-Guess Game is a version of hangman, but without the brutality of hanging a stick figure. Although the stick figure is saved, you will not be by enetering this game. You will find many scary elements such as, a spooky background image, some scary words, and the horrific color of red.

## Why should you play a less lethal version of hangman?

1. Prove you aren't a psychopath
2. It's more fun than Fortnite
3. This is my first real project using Javascript

In all seriousness, this took a long time to complete and was my first real challenge when it came to Javascript.

## Now it is time, play my game (please)

You can access the game [here](https://alaclair.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/ "Word-Guess-Game")
